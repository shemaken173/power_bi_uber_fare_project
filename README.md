# ðŸš– Power BI Uber Fare Analysis Project

The Power BI Uber Fare Analysis Project is a data visualization and business intelligence solution designed to provide actionable insights into Uber ride fares. Using the uber_enhanced dataset, the project analyzes key performance metrics such as Total Fare Amount, Average Fare Amount, and Trip Volume, enabling data-driven decision-making for ride pricing, customer trends, and operational efficiency.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
The **Power BI Uber Fare Analysis Project** is designed to analyze Uber trip fare data using interactive visualizations and DAX calculations. The goal is to identify fare patterns, revenue trends, and customer behavior insights for better business decision-making.

This project uses **Power BI** for dashboard creation and **DAX** for calculating key performance indicators (KPIs) like **Total Fare Amount**, **Average Fare**, and **Trip Count**.
