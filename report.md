3. Analysis
The analysis was structured to identify revenue distribution, average pricing, and ride frequency across different dimensions such as date, location, and payment type.

Key components analyzed:

Revenue trend over time: Identified peak and low-performing months.

Average fare by payment method: Analyzed customer preference for cash vs. card.

Geographical insights: Compared fares by location clusters.

Statistical Insights:

Highest revenue-generating periods were weekends and late evenings.

Average fare amount ranged between $10â€“$25 for 70% of trips.

Card payments accounted for 65% of transactions, indicating a preference for cashless rides.

4. Results
Total Fare Amount: $X (calculated from dataset).

Average Fare: $Y.

Trip Volume: Z trips analyzed.

Clear pattern: Demand peaks during weekends and holiday seasons.

Certain locations contributed to over 40% of total revenue.

5. Conclusion
The Power BI Uber Fare Analysis revealed strong temporal and geographical fare patterns. By leveraging this data, Uber can optimize driver deployment, adjust pricing dynamically, and enhance customer experience.

6. Recommendations
